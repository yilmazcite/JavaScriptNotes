# JavaScriptNotes
<ul>
<li>I will update this repository with the notes that I have been taking while learning JavaScript.</li>
<li>The two main courses I have been following on Udemy belong to <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/">Angela Yu</a> and <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/">Jonas Schmedtmann</a>.</li>
<li>Since I follow these two courses as I take down notes, the notes will also consist of some examples and challenges used in these courses.</li><br>
<li>Please finally be aware that the notes that I have taken before and am currently taking are merely the products of what I have understood as I move on and that I do not claim that they are fully equipped. Although I double-check each and every single one of the files, they might be incompetent and inadequate on any level.</li>
<li>I hope it helps.</li>
</ul>
